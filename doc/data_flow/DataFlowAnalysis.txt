* CFG visualization
    To aid in debugging, we implemented a grapher.scala that takes in a CFG,
    and auto generates a string that represents a graph which graphviz can read, and generate an svg of the graph.
    We can set a debug flag that uses grapher.scala to take the cfg in IR2, and output the string into a .gv file which is later run through dot to make an
    image of the CFG.
